[Sipwise](https://sipwise.tech/) is a Web Application that helps user keep track of their water intake and stay hydrated through the day.

It can be difficult to tell how much water we really should be drinking throughout the day. Traditional advice of having '8 glasses a day' did not take into account differences in weight, activity level, water content through rest of diet (food and drinks), or even the general climate around the person <sup>1</sup>. Going by thirst is a better indicator, but this can be difficult to determine and people may want help while improving their water habits. 

This tool was made to simplify that process somewhat, so that people can get a better idea of if they might need to drink more/less water. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install Sipwise.

```bash
# install npm packages
npm install

# run the project on port localhost:3000
cd monitor
npm run start
```

## Usage
